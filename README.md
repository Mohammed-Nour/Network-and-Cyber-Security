## Lab 1: Security Compliance

**Objective**:  
Understand and analyze security regulations related to sensitive data handling (e.g., personal or financial data).

**Key Activities**:  
- Review regulations such as GDPR, Federal Law 152-FZ, PCI DSS, and Bank of Russia Regulation No. 719-ÐŸ.  
- Summarize their main requirements and applicability.  
- Assess their effectiveness and provide recommendations.

## Lab 2: Threat Modeling

**Objective**:  
Conduct a threat modeling exercise to identify and mitigate security threats within a banking infrastructure.

**Key Activities**:  
- Decompose the system into assets, entry points, and trust levels.  
- Use STRIDE methodology to identify potential threats.  
- Create Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) and attack trees.  
- Assess threats using CVSS and suggest countermeasures.

## Lab 3: Endpoint Security (EDR/SIEM)

**Objective**:  
Implement and understand endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security information and event management (SIEM) using Wazuh.

**Key Activities**:  
- Deploy and configure Wazuh for endpoint monitoring.  
- Monitor file integrity, detect vulnerabilities, and identify cryptominers.  
- Analyze alerts and system behavior using Wazuh's dashboard.
